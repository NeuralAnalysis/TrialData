% function trial_data = dupeAndShift(trial_data,varargin)
%
%   Will duplicate any specified variables and shift them some number of
% bins. This is mainly to let you preserve history while cutting and
% pasting chunks and data.
%
%   KEEP THIS IN  MIND:
%       -> Negative shift values slide the signal backwards, effectively
%           adding HISTORY to the current time bin
%       -> Positive shift values slide the signal forwards, effectively
%           adding THE FUTURE to the current time bin
%
% Creates new fields in the trial_data struct of format:
%       [ORIGINAL_VAR_NAME '_shift']
% And the size of this new array will be:
%       ORIGINAL_SIZE * NUMBER OF SHIFTS
%
% Will truncate to remove all non-overlapping segments, and will adjust the
% idx fields to reflect that.
%
% INPUTS:
%   trial_data : (struct) obvious
%   varargin   : pairs of ...'field',SHIFT,...
%       SHIFT is given in number of bins
%   params     : (struct) must be the last input!
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   trial_data : original struct with added _shift fields
