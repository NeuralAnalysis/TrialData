% function [noise_covar,td] = getNoiseCovar(trial_data, params)
%
% [noise_covar] = getNoiseCovar(trial_data, params);
%   Computes covariance matrix of noise, given actual signals and model
% predicted signals.
%
% INPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct
%   params     : struct containing parameters
%     .actual_signals : (cell) actual signals. Two options:
%                           1) {'NAME1','NAME2',etc}
%                           2) {'NAME1',idx; 'NAME2',idx; etc}
%                                   Here idx is which columns to use
%                                   Note: can use 'all' as idx for all
%     .modeled_signals : (cell) modeled signals. Two options:
%                           1) {'NAME1','NAME2',etc}
%                           2) {'NAME1',idx; 'NAME2',idx; etc}
%                                   Here idx is which columns to use
%                                   Note: can use 'all' as idx for all
%     .model_name     : unique name under which residuals will be put
%                           (will be postfixed by '_residuals')
%     .use_trials     : which trials to use for noise_covar (default: all)
%     .do_plot        : flag to make pairwiseCorr plot (default: false)
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   noise_covar : noise covariance matrix for given signal
%   td : output trial_data structure with new field '*_residuals'
