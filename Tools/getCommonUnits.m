% function trial_data = getCommonUnits(trial_data)
%
%   Looks across all trials of a trial_data struct and ensure the units
% are all common. This is mostly a sanity check/housekeeping thing.
%
% NOTE: each array is currently hard-coded to max out at 96 channels
%
% INPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   trial_data : same struct, but with unmatched units removed
