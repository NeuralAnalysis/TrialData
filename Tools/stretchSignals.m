%   Time warps signals to be the same length. Useful for averaging, etc.
%   Note: for idx_ fields, adjusts to new sampling length and uses ceil to
%   make it an integer. So the precision of these idx_ fields now depends
%   on the 'samples' value chosen.
%
% INPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct
%   params     : params struct
%       .samples  : how many samples to use in interpolation (default: 100)
% OUTPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct with signals that are time-stretched
