% This function will smooth and/or square root transform spikes
%
% INPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct
%   params     :
%     .signals        : field names to smooth (single string or cell array)
%                          Note: defaults to all signals
%     .do_smoothing   : flag to convolve spikes with gaussian (default: true)
%     .kernel_SD      : kernel s.d. for smoothing (default: 0.05)
%     .sqrt_transform : flag to square root transform (default: false)
%                           Mostly meant for spiking data
%     .calc_rate      : flag to calculate rate (divide by bin size)
%                           Mostly meant for spiking data (default: false)

% OUTPUTS:

% function data_smooth = smoothSpikesForPCA(data,dt,kernel_SD)
%
%   Convolves spike counts or firing rates with a Guassian kernel to smooth
% the responses. Made for spikes but works well with other signals as well.
% Used by getPCA. Based on gaussian_smoothing code from Juan's proc folder.
%
% INPUTS:
%   data      : array of data (rows: time, columns: signals)
%   dt        : size of time steps in fr in s
%   kernel_SD : gaussian kernel standard deviation
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   fr_smooth : smoothed data
