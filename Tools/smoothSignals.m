% function trial_data = smoothSignals(trial_data,params)
%
% This function will smooth any signal.
%
% HINT: instead of params struct, can just pass SIGNALS input if you are
% okay just using the default parameters.
%
% INPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct
%   params     :
%     .signals        : field names to smooth (single string or cell array)
%                          Note: must be passed in
%     .width          : kernel width (std. dev) for smoothing (default: 0.05)
%     .calc_rate      : flag to calculate rate (divide by bin size)
%                           Mostly meant for spiking data (default: false)
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct with all (signals{}) fields smoothed
