% function trial_data = getTargetDirection(trial_data, params)
% 
%   Computes time-varying target direction (relative to hand position) for
% each trial in trial_data. So, it's a time-varying angle. Another function
% that is pretty Matt-specific at the moment, but it may be useful for
% others. Really only for center out, too.
%
% INPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct
%   params     : struct of parameters
%     .reach_distance : how far the target is from the center
%     .dt             : size of bins in trial_data in s
%     .hold_time      : length of outer hold time in s
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   trial_data : struct with 'targ' field added
