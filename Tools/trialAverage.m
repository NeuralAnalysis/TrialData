% function [avg_data, cond_idx] = trialAverage(trial_data, conditions, params)
%
%   Returns struct where each entry is an average for all time-varying
% signals across trials for some condition. This function can interpolate
% to stretch/shrink all trials to the same number of points, but it does
% not trim data. This can be easily done with trimTD.
%
% Note: returns all fields, but for meta parameters, etc, you can average
% across trials with different values. If they all are the same, fills in
% field for that condition with that value. Otherwise, adds cell array that
% contains all unique values, largely for later reference.
%
% INPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct
%   params     : struct with parameters
%     .conditions : (string or cell array) the field name(s) in trial_data
%                       avg_data will have an entry for each unique combo
%     .do_stretch : (bool) whether to stretch/shrink trials to uniform length
%                       if false, all trials must have same number of points
%     .num_samp   : (int) how many time points to use for interpolation
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   avg_data : struct representing average across trials for each condition
%   cond_idx : cell array containing indices for each condition
%
% EXAMPLES:
%   e.g. to average over all target directions and task epochs
%       avg_data = trialAverage(trial_data,{'target_direction','epoch'});
%       Note: gives a struct of size #_TARGETS * #_EPOCHS
