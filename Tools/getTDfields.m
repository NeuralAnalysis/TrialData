% fn = getTDfields(trial_data,which_type)
%
%   Will return a cell array which lists all of the field names of a given
% type. Useful to list all spiking variables, kinematic variables, etc.
%
% INPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct
%   which_type : (string) the type of field. Options:
%                   1) 'cont'   : continuous (pos, vel, force, etc)
%                   2) 'spikes' : neural data fields
%                   3) 'arrays' : similar to spikes but returns array names
%                   4) 'time'   : names of all time varying fields
%                   5) 'idx'    : name of all time index fields
%                   6) 'neural'  : any neural signals (e.g. M1_WHATEVER)
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   fn : the fieldnames of which_type
