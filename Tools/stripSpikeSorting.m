%   This function, as the name implies, strips away the sort codes for all
% of the spiking arrays. Essentially, summing all of the spike counts in
% each bin for all units identified on a single electrode.
%
% WARNING! This code will break if trials have different unit_guides. It
% assumes that the whole struct is coming from the same array(s). This can
% maybe be fixed in the future.
