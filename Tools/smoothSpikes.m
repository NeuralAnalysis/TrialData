% function trial_data = smoothSpikes(trial_data,params)
%
% This function will smooth and/or square root transform spikes
%
% INPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct
%   params     :
%     .sqrt_transform : flag to square root transform spikes (default: true)
%     .do_smoothing   : flag to convolve spikes with gaussian (default: true)
%     .kernel_SD      : kernel s.d. for smoothing (default: 2*bin_size)
%     .calc_fr        : flag to calculate FR (divide by bin size)
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct with all _spikes fields smoothed
