% trial_data = subtractConditionMean(trial_data, params)
%
%   Finds the mean across all conditions for each time point and subtracts
% this value. Works on all time-varying signals. This is what Churchland
% and Co. do for their jPCA work etc. Note that this is designed to be done
% AFTER a call to trialAverage, and thus assumes that each entry represents
% a condition that you want to average over.
%
% INPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct
%   params     : parameter struct
%     .cond_idx : which condition entries to use for mean
%                   Note: will subtract this mean from all entries
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct, with mean subtracted for each signal
%
