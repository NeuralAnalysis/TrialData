% function trial_data = getMoveOnsetAndPeak(trial_data, params)
%
%   This will find a time bin representing movement onset and peak speed
% Currently for kinematics but could be easily adapted to force, etc.
%
%   Constrains the looking to a window specified by start_idx and end_idx
%
% INPUTS:
%   trial_data : (struct) trial_data struct
%   params     : parameter struct
%     .start_idx    : (string) field name of idx to use for start of window
%     .end_idx      : (string) field name to use for end of window
%     .which_method : (string) how to compute
%                           'peak' : uses acceleration and peak speed
%                           'thresh' : uses a basic velocity threshold
%                       Note: defaults to peak. In thresh, will not return
%                       a peak speed as a field.
%     .min_ds       : minimum diff(speed) to find movement onset
%     .s_thresh     : % speed threshold in cm/s (secondary method if first fails)
%     .peak_idx_offset  :  indices after start_idx to find max speed. 
%     .start_idx_offset :  indices after start_idx to find movement onset
%     .which_field     : which field to find movement onset from 
%     .field_idx       : idx of the above field to find movement onset from
%     .onset_name      : field to add for onset (default: 'movement_on')
%     .peak_name       : field to add for peak (default: 'peak_speed')
% OUTPUTS:
%   trial_data : same struct, with fields for:
%       idx_peak_speed
%       idx_movement_onset
