% function trial_data = getMoveOnsetAndPeak(trial_data,min_ds)
%
%   This will find a time bin representing movement onset and peak speed
% Currently for kinematics but could be easily adapted to force, etc.
%
% INPUTS:
%   trial_data : (struct) trial_data struct
%   params     : parameter struct
%     .min_ds     : minimum diff(speed) to find movement onset
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   trial_data : same struct, with fields for:
%       idx_peak_speed and
%       idx_movement_onset
