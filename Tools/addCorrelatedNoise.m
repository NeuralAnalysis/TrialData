% function [td] = addCorrelatedNoise(trial_data, params)
%
%   Add correlated noise to given signal
%
% INPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct
%   params     : struct containing parameters
%     .signals : (cell) actual signals. Two options:
%                           1) {'NAME1','NAME2',etc}
%                           2) {'NAME1',idx; 'NAME2',idx; etc}
%                                   Here idx is which columns to use
%                                   Note: can use 'all' as idx for all
%     .noise_covar     : covariance matrix of noise to be added
%     .use_trials     : which trials to use
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   td : output trial_data structure with new field '*_noisy'
