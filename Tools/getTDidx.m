% function [return_idx, trial_data] = getTDidx(trial_data, varargin)
%
%   This function will return indices for trials in trial_data that meet
% the criteria defined by varargin. varargin should be in pairs, where the
% first entry is the field name and the second is the desired value. It's
% pretty much agnostic to what fields trial_data contains, at least for all
% of the use cases that I've come across so far.
%
% Basically, first entry is the field to use. Second is an appropriate
% piece of information. There are a couple more useful things:
%   1) Use ...'range',[start,end]... to get a range of consecutive trials
%       that meet all other criteria. If start and end are integers, will
%       return everything in between (ends included). However, if start/end
%       are fractions, it will treat them like percentages
%       There is the extra option to pass a cell like {'last',N} to get the
%       last N trials.
%
%   2) Use ...'rand',N... to get N random trials that meet all other criteria
%       (including the range specified above)
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   return_idx : list of indices that meet the desired criteria
%   trial_data : the trials of the struct that correspond to return_idx
%
% EXAMPLES:
%  e.g. to get all baseline trials:
%       idx = getTDidx(trial_data,'epoch','BL');
%  e.g. to get all force field trials to the pi/2 direction
%       idx = getTDidx(trial_data,'epoch','AD','perturbation','FF','target_direction',pi/2)
%  e.g. to get 10 random trials from the first half of baseline
%       idx = getTDidx(trial_data,'epoch','BL','range',[0 0.5],'rand',10);
