% function combined = appendTDs(varargin)
%
%   Stitches together an arbitrary number of trial data structs in time.
% This is useful if you want to plot discontinuous data, for instance 500
% ms after target presentation and 500 ms after movement onset in a
% variable delay center out task.
%
% NOTE: the way this works, there are some best practices. You should make
% every struct you append have no overlapping time values (unless you want
% them to repeat). You should also pass them in chronologically, so the
% idx_ fields continue to have something resembling meaning (unless you
% don't want them to).
%
% To do:
%   1) check that all have same metadata
%
% INPUTS:
%   varargin : any number of trial_data structs
%       Note: must have same trials in the same order
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   combined : a new trial_data struct with each trial combined
%                adds field 'stitch_marks', which has the bin numbers
%                corresponding to the beginning of each discontinuity
