% function trial_data = reorderTDfields(trial_data)
%
% This is my total OCD-appeasing function. It will:
%   1) Put metadata at the top
%   2) Put idx_ fields second, in order of value for each trial
%   3) put continuous/time signals third (EMG last)
%   4) put spikes and neural fields last (and group by array name)
