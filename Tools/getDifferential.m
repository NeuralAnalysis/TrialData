% function trial_data = getDifferential(trial_data,params)
%
%   Differentiates a signal (e.g. get velocity from position). Uses the
% GRADIENT function to compute the derivative.
%
% INPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct
%   params     : struct input with the following fields
%       .signal       : (string) which signal (field) to use
%       .alias        : (string, optional) what name to use in struct
%                           Default is to add a 'd' in front of signal name
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct with differential field
