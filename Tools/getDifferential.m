% function trial_data = getDifferential(trial_data,signal,alias)
%
%   Differentiates a signal (e.g. get velocity from position)
%
% INPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct
%   params     : struct input with the following fields
%       .signal       : (string) which signal (field) to use
%       .alias        : (string, optional) what name to use in struct
%                           Default is to add a 'd' in front of signal name
%       .intial_value : value for signal at t = 0
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct with differential field (reordered logically)
%
% TO DO:
%   - support for multiple signals?
