% function [trial_data,td_params] = parseFileByTrial(data, params)
%
%   Wrapper function to create trial_data structs. Currently only supports
% CDS.
% 
% NOTE: Discretizes everything to the dt of the CDS kinematics (by default
% should be 10 ms bins, I believe). Can rebin later if desired using binTD.
%
% INPUTS:
%   data     : a CDS file or BDF file (not yet supported)
%   params   : a struct containing parameters
%     .meta          : a struct with a field for each meta parameter you want attached
%                       to this file. This can handle any arbitrary information!
%     .event_list   : Which cds.trials events to add to struct
%                       Format: {'CDS_TRIAL_TABLE_NAME','ALIAS'; ... etc ...}
%                       Can ignore ALIAS and give Nx1 cell vector if you want
%                       By default, assumes startTime and endTime exist,
%                       and attempts to add tgtOnTime and goCueTime if possible
%     .array_alias   : Aliases for renaming arrays from CDS names
%                       Format: {'CDS_NAME','NEW_NAME'; ...etc...}
%     .exclude_units : ID for which units to exclude (Default: [0,255])
%                       NOTE: this default gets rid of unsorted!
%     .trial_results : which reward codes to use ('R','A','F','I') (Default: {'R'})
%     .extra_time    : [time before, time after] beginning and end of trial (default [0.2 0.2] sec)
%     .all_points    : flag to include all data points. Thus, disregards extra_time
%                       and trial_results. Each trial ends at trial_start of the one after
%     .pos_offset    : offset (in units of cds.pos) to zero position (default [0,0])
%     .include_ts    : Flag to denote whether to include timestamps aligned
%                       start of the trial or not. If so, includes a cell
%                       array of timestamps for each trial, one for each
%                       source of neural data.
%     .include_start :  Flag to denot whether to include an extra column
%                       which contains the 'real time' start for each trial
%                       Useful for comparing in non-standard tasks
%       
%     .include_naming: Flag to denote whether to include a conversion
%                       matrix between the labels that appear on the screen when you are doing sensory mapping
%                       versus the labels that are given to the recorded
%                       file.
% OUTPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct! Huzzah!
%
% TIPS:
%   I recommend the following extra function calls afterwards
%       trial_data = getMoveOnsetAndPeak(trial_data);
%       trial_data = removeBadTrials(trial_data);
%       trial_data = getCommonUnits(trial_data);
