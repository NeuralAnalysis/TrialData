% function x = get_vars(trial_data, signals)

%   Boring utility subfunction used by things like getModel to turn a
% signals input into a matrix of data. The signals parameter is the
% standard {'NAME',idx; etc} format used by getPCA and getModel, so this
% could be a generally useful function to you...
