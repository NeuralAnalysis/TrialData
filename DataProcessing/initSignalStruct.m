function signal_info = initSignalStruct(varargin)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
% This function serves as a way to initialize the signal struct input to
% make the convertDataToTD processing code simpler. See the code below
% where the struct is instantiated to see a list of parameters that you can
% modify.
%
% INPUTS:
%   varargin : any number of 'name','value' pairs
%
%   Parameters that can be modified:
%     1) filename : Must be specified! Where to find the file.
%     2) routine  : This contains an inline function handle (@) to a file
%                   that contains the code necessary to process the data.
%           Note that filename and routine must only have one entry per
%           struct. Together, these define the unique processing operations
%           taken by the convertDataToTD code.
%     3) params : a struct containing arbitrary parameters for the
%                         routine, if desired.
%     4) name : Must be specified, but can be a cell array of arbitrary
%               length. Each provided name will put one signal in the
%               trial_data struct, in a field corresponding to the name.
%     5) label : which signals to take out of the file. This is most useful
%                when using the built-in processing (e.g. to select analog
%                channels recorded on cerebus) but could have creative uses
%                when interfacing with your custom code.
%     6) operation : an inline function handle (e.g. @diff). Note this is
%                    distinct from routine since it runs AFTER the data has
%                    been loaded and grouped. So for a given name, this
%                    will operate on the continuous data between the
%                    loading routine and any subsequent built-in
%                    processing. Useful for differential EMGs, for example.
%            NOTE: As of now, this function must only take a single matrix
%            as input, where TIME is actually the columns and signals are
%            the rows. This is the transposed version of the trial_data
%            standard, but was done to accomodate some basic matlab
%            functions with simplicity (e.g. diff)
%     7) type : (string) what type of signal we are processing. Options:
%             - 'generic' : any old time-varying signal
%             - 'spikes' : spiking data. Will add a unit_guide [elec, unit]
%                          Doesn't have to be from NEV, you can use this
%                          with your own processing code.
%             - 'lfp' : (NOT IMPLEMENTED) will eventually filter LFP bands
%                       using continuously sampled data
%             - 'emg' : will do a rectifying and filtering (see subfunction
%                       in code. Can pass in parameters in the main code)
%             - 'trigger' : a pulse signal. Code will turn it into an idx_.
%                           Can pass in trigger thresholding parameter
%             - 'event' : bin number that will become an idx_ field
%                           Note for now, it assumes the processing code
%                           will spit out a bin number in the correct time
%                           frame, and won't do any corrections.
%
%    NOTE: If name is a cell array of length > 1, it will process multiple
%    signals from the specified file. Two options for other parameters...
%    1) pass in each parameter as a cell array of the same length of names,
%       where each entry corresponds to the matching name. You should be
%       able to pass in '' or [] if you just want to use defaults for any
%       entry in the cell array.
%    2) fill them in normally or do nothing. This code will replicate them
%       to be of the length of names.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   signal_info : the struct
%
% Here are a few potentially useful examples of how to initialize:
%
% 1) a way to take split arrays going to one pedestal and separate them
% initSignalStruct( ... % M1 neural data
%     'filename','blackrock_data.nev', ...
%     'name',{'M1','PMd'}, ...
%     'type','spikes', ...
%     'label',{m1_idx,pmd_idx}) % label should be electrode indices here
% 
% 2) a way to do differential EMGs recorded with cerebus
% initSignalStruct( ...
%     'filename','emg_data.ns5', ...
%     'name',{'Biceps','Triceps'}, ...
%     'label',{ {'BicepsElec1','BicepsElec2'}, {'TricesElec1','TricepsElec2'} }, ...
%     'operation',@diff)
% note that 'label' points to the name in the datafile of the desired
% signals, and 'name' is the field name that will be in the TD
% 
% 3) a way to load signals recorded with some other means
% initSignalStruct( ...
%     'filename','analog_signals.dat', ...
%     'routine',@yourPersonalCodeToProcessData, ...
%     'name',{'pressure','motor_commands'}, ...
%     'type',{'','trigger'}) % for type, '' defaults to 'generic'
% 
% 4) a way to load events that were tracked manually and saved
% initSignalStruct( ...
%     'filename','tracked_events.mat', ...
%     'routine',@addEventsToTD, ...
%     'name',{'FootStrike','FootOff'}, ...
%     'type','event'), ...

%
% To do:
%   - implement some extra checks for the name input (e.g. what if length
%   of label is greater than name)
