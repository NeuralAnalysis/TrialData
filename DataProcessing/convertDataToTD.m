function [trial_data,td_params] = convertDataToTD(varargin)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% This function provides a more flexible and experiment-agnostic framework
% to bring data into the trial_data world. Basic functionality for
% processing common signals (spiking neurons, EMG, soon LFP) is
% built-in, but it can be expanded to any arbitrary data type, format, or
% setup using the 'routine' and 'operation' inputs (see initSignalStruct
% for some usage details).
%
% INPUTS:
%   1) signal_info : see initSignalStruct
%   2) params      : (optional struct) allows you to overwrite defaults
%       .meta            : (struct) adds all fields as meta info to trials
%       .bin_size        : (default: 0.01) the standard time vector
%       .trigger_thresh  : (default: 1) threshold for trigger signals
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct
%   td_params  : contains all parameters, including inputs
%
% Things to do:
%   - implement LFP. It's important to ensure indices match up with spikes!
%   - deal with case where signals have lower sampling rate than bin_size.
%       Do we upsample those signals or increase the bin_size?
%       Or, do we limit bin_size to the lowest sample rate?
%   - Implement read_waveforms and include_spike_times
