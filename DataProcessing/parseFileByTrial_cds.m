% INPUTS:
%   cds    : CDS object
%   params : a struct containing parameters
%     .meta          : a struct with a field for each meta parameter you want attached
%                       to this file. This can handle any arbitrary information!
%     .event_names   : Which cds.trials events to add to struct
%                       Format: {'CDS_TRIAL_TABLE_NAME','ALIAS'; ... etc ...}
%                       Can ignore ALIAS and give cell vector if you want
%     .array_alias   : Aliases for renaming arrays from CDS names
%                       Format: {'CDS_NAME','NEW_NAME'; ...etc...}
%     .exclude_units : ID for which units to exclude (Default: [0,255])
%                       NOTE: this default gets rid of unsorted!
%     .trial_results : which reward codes to use ('R','A','F','I')
%     .bin_size      : default 0.01 sec
%     .extra_time    : [time before, time after] beginning and end of trial (default [0.5 0.3] sec)
%     .all_points    : flag to include all data points. Thus, disregards extra_time
%                       and each trial ends at trial_start of the one after
%     .pos_offset    : offset (in units of cds.pos) to zero position
%
