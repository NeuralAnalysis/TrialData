% function [trial_data, dPCA_info] = getDPCA(trial_data,varargin)
%
%   Finds dPCA for a dataset according to arbitrary conditions.
%
%   [trial_data, dPCA_info] = getDPCA(trial_data, ...conditions... params)
%       Input any number of conditions. The last input should always be
% params struct. Conditions are strings (for fields, e.g. 'target_direction')
% or cell arrays of trial indices.
%
%
% INPUTS:
%   params : parameter struct
%     .signals         : (cell) which signals. Two options:
%                           1) {'NAME1','NAME2',etc}
%                           2) {'NAME1',idx; 'NAME2',idx; etc}
%                                   Here idx is which columns to use
%                                   Note: can use 'all' as idx for all
%     .num_dims        : how many dPCA dimensions
%     .do_plot         : flag to make dPCA plot
%     .combined_params : see dPCA code or example below
%     .marg_names      : name of each marginalization
%     .marg_colors     : color for each marginalization
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   trial_data : data struct with dPCA projections added
%   dPCA_info  : struct with info about dPCA analysis
%
% TO DO:
%   - add dPCA projections to trial table
%       Would be getting geometry from trial averaging and projecting
%       single trials (add a guide to say what each dPC is)
%   - figure out naming parameters and plotting parameters, make them
%        writeable
%   - support different numbers of conditions for different conditions?
%           e.g. if Condition1 is task and Condition2 is target, can have 6
%           targets in one task and 8 targets in another. Currently you
%           need to have the same number of targets for all tasks
