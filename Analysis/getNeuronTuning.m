function [tcs,fr,covar] = getNeuronTuning(trial_data,which_method,params)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% will compute tuning curves using desired method
% A WORK IN PROGRESS
%
% INPUTS:
%   trial_data   : the struct
%   which_method : how to get the tuning
%          1) 'regress'  : cosine regression
%          2) 'vonmises' : regression of von mises (not implemented)
%          3) 'glm'      : glm of velocity (not implemented)
%   params       : parameter struct
%     .covariate : which covariate to use (e.g. 'target')
%     .array     : which array to use. Will do all neurons independently
%     .win       : window {'idx_OF_START',BINS_AFTER; 'idx_OF_END', BINS_AFTER}
%
% To do:
%   1) implement glm and von mises methods
%   2) support multiple arrays
%   3) suppor arbitrary covariates, somehow?
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   tcs   : tuning curves [MEAN, MODULATION DEPTH, PREFERRED DIRECTION]
%   fr    : firing rates for each trial (rows) and neuron (cols)
%   covar : covariate (e.g. target direction) for each trial
%               last two outpus are the data used for tcs
