% function [trial_data,pca_info] = getPCA(trial_data, params)
%
% [trial_data,pca_info] = getPCA(trial_data, params);
%   Computes PCA projection for time-varying data. Will add scores to each trial
% for use later. Must pass in 'signals' field for struct. Note that this can
% be a cell of strings to pool data from multiple arrays. In this case, the
% rows of w will be as if you concatenated the columns of signals together in the
% order they were provided.
%
% trial_data = getPCA(trial_data, pca_info);
%   Uses an old w from previous getPCA call to add scores to
% trial_data as SIGNALS{:}_pca.
%
% NOTE: centers data by default! Thus to reconstruct scores you need the
%       means of each signal.
%
% INPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct
%   params     : struct containing parameters
%     .signals        : (cell) which signals. Two options:
%                           1) {'NAME1','NAME2',etc}
%                           2) {'NAME1',idx; 'NAME2',idx; etc}
%                                   Here idx is which columns to use
%                                   Note: can use 'all' as idx for all
%     .trial_idx      : which trials to use for PCA (default: all)
%                         Note: when adding projections, does so for all
%                         trials in trial_data, not just trial_idx
%     .do_plot        : flag to make scree plot (default: false)
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   trial_data : old struct with added field for scores for each trial
%                   NOTE: if passing in old w, only returns this
%   pca_info   : struct of PCA information
%     .w          : weight matrix for PCA projections
%     .scores     : scores for the PCs
%     .eigen      : eigenvalues for PC ranking
%     .params     : the parameters used for this analysis
%
% EXAMPLES:
%   e.g. to compute covariance matrix
%       [~,pca_info] = getPCA(trial_data, struct('signals','M1_spikes'));
%   e.g. to add scores to trial_data later using the above output
%       trial_data = getPCA(trial_data, pca_info);
