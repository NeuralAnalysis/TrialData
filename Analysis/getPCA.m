% function varargout = getPCA(trial_data, varargin)
%
% [w, mu, scores, trial_data, params] = getPCA(trial_data, params);
%   Computes PCA projection for neural data. If you request trial_data as
% a final output, will add scores to each trial for use later. Must pass in
% 'array' field for struct. Note that this can be a cell of strings to pool
% data from multiple arrays. In this case, the rows of w will be as if you
% concatenated the two arrays together in the order they were provided.
%
% trial_data = getPCA(trial_data, w, mu, params);
%   Uses an old w and mu from previous getPCA call to add scores to
% trial_data as ARRAY_pca. Params is still needed to specify the array or
% if you want smoothing, etc.
%
%   NOTE: always de-means! Theoretically this could be modified to take a
% parameter to skip the de-meaning.
%
% INPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct
%   params     : struct containing parameters
%     .array          : which units (can be cell array with multiple)
%     .trial_idx      : which trials to use (default: all)
%     .neurons        : which neurons to use (default: all) Note: for multiple arrays,
%                       neurons should be cell array with indices for each array
%     .sqrt_transform : flag to square root transform spikes (default: true)
%     .do_smoothing   : flag to convolve spikes with gaussian (default: true)
%     .kernel_SD      : kernel s.d. for smoothing (default: 2*bin_size)
%     .trial_avg      : flag to trial average (requires condition input) (default: false)
%     .trial_avg_cond : (string/cell) which conditions to average over
%     .do_plot        : flag to make scree plot (default: false)
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   w          : weight matrix for PCA projections
%   scores     : scores for the PCs
%   eigen      : eigenvalues for PC ranking
%   mu         : mean for each input (for de-meaning later)
%                  NOTE: if you use w later, you MUST demean using mu!!!
%   trial_data : old struct with added field for scores for each trial
%                   NOTE: if passing in old w and mu, only returns this
%
% EXAMPLES:
%   e.g. to compute covariance matrix
%       [w,mu,~,~,params] = getPCA(trial_data, struct('array','M1','bin_size',0.01));
%   e.g. to add scores to trial_data later using the above output
%       trial_data = getPCA(trial_data, w, mu, params);
