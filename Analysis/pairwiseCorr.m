% function [rho,sort_idx] = pairwiseCorr(trial_data,params)
%
%   Compute pairwise correlations between neurons in _spikes.
%   Can order them to show structure, a la Cunningham.
%
% INPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct
%   params     : parameter struct
%     .signals        : which signals (format as in getPCA or getModel)
%     .trial_idx      : which trials to use (default: all)
%     .cluster_order  : flag to reorder cells to show structure (default: false)
%     .cluster_arrays : flag treat arrays differently when clustering
%     .do_norm        : normalize each row/col to go from -1 to 1
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   rho        : pairwise correlation matrix for _spikes
%   sort_idx   : indices of original _spikes inputs for sort
