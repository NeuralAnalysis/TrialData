% function [trial_data,glm_info] = getGLM(trial_data,params)
%
%   This function will fit a GLM to take any combination of inputs and
% predict some outputs. Actually has two modes:
%
%   [trial_data,glm_info] = getGLM(trial_data,params);
%       This mode will fit a GLM and return the struct with GLM predictions
%       added as a field, as well as GLM parameters.
%
%   trial_data            = getGLM(trial_data,glm_info)
%       This mode will take the glm_info from a previous getGLM call and
%       add GLM predictions as a field to trial_data (e.g. for new trials)
%
%
% INPUTS:
%   trial_data : the struct
%   in_struct  : a struct of inputs. Can be one of two things:
%       1) glm_info   : struct of model fit info from getGLM call (for predicting)
%       2) params     : parameter struct (NOTE: must NOT have 'b' or 's' fields)
%            .glm_name     : (string) unique name for this model fit
%            .in_signals   : (cell) GLM inputs in form {'name',idx; 'name',idx};
%            .out_signals  : (cell) GLM outputs in form {'name',idx}
%            .train_idx    : trial indices for training (will predict for all)
%            .do_lasso     : flag to use lasso regularization (default: false)
%            .lasso_lambda : lambda parameter for lasso
%            .lasso_alpha  : alpha parameter for lasso
%
% Note: at the moment, only supports one output field. But can have any
%       arbitrary number of input fields, which it will stick together
%
% EXAMPLES:
%   e.g. to fit a GLM
%       [trial_data,glm_info] = getGLM(trial_data(train_trials),params);
%   e.g. to use a previous model make predictions for new data
%       trial_data            = getGLM(trial_data(new_trials),glm_info)
